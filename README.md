Part of my daily job is looking at results from various AppSec discovery sources.  One of the most common failures I have to review is with proper Web security headers.  

This has been done before and probably much more efficiently than this simple script would do.
Also this was generated with the help of Github Copilot, at least initially, I am a terrible coder and it is not my day job.
